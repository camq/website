            <strong>
                <p> I am passionate about cooking, traveling, and being active. </p>
                <p> From a young age I have always enjoyed cooking. Since the age of fourteen, I have been responsible for cooking the family Christmas dinner. That is assuming I was in the country as at that age I spent a lot of time traveling the world to compete at trampoline competitions. I started competing when I was six and retired at age eighteen having competed in all the continents (except Antarctica) and having represented Team Canada at two World Age Group competitions. </p>
                <p> After retiring I shifted my focus towards studying. I spent little time traveling, until (with only two days notice) I got the opportunity to backpack through Europe. Over the course of the trip, I managed to visit seventeen different countries. When I returned to Vancouver I had little chance to recuperate as I was off to Montreal to study French for a term at the University of Montreal. </p>
                <p> Now when I have a few minutes to relax, I enjoy watching scientific videos on YouTube with my favorite channels being Numberphile, Computerphile, CPG Grey, and Standupmaths. When I have more time, I enjoy streaming shows on Netflix including Suits, White Collar, and House of Cards. </p>
