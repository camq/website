        <h1>Movement Classification Through Data Mining</h1>
        <strong>
            <p>Collected acceleration data from smartphone sensors using Matlab and exported the data to excel spreadsheets. Data from a pubicly available dataset was then used to train and test different classifiers with the goal of achieving an accuracy greater than 96.4% (the best accuracy reported in the literature). An accuracy of 98.5% was achieved in addition to a quicker classifier with an accuracy of 97.8%</p>

The backend is used to perform useful queries on the data such as queries on courses, past course averages, and room scheduling (and displaying the timetable along with the schedule). This was the term project for CPSC 310 (intro to software engineering)</p>

        <h1>Virtual Traffic Light</h1>
        <strong>
            <p>My first basic program. The application allows the user to control the light with the arrow keys on the keyboard. The up and down keys change the light from red, yellow, and green. The left and right keys change the advanced left turn signal. If the user hits the space bar it simulates a broken traffic light (flashing red). This traffic light was adapted from an optional practice question for CPSC 110 (Introduction to Computation and Programming) which required only a timed loop between red, yellow, and green.</p>

        <h1>Decreasing Liquid Battery Decay</h1>
        <strong>
            <p>Completed a theoretical research project on decreasing the cross contamination of large-scale liquid batteries (specifically for Vanadium Redox Flow batteries). The research was conducted under the supervision of a Ph.D. student and concluded that 3 different configurations of composite membranes warranted further research. The findings were presented at UBC's 2015 Multidisciplinary Undergraduate Research Conference. I enjoyed this project because it was a step out of my comfort zone and dealt with different ways to store renewable energy.</p>
